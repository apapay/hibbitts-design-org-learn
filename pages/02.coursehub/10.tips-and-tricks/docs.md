Get the most out of Your Open Course Hub!

##### Displaying only page content (when embedding pages)

When displaying Open Course Hub pages within another system (e.g. LMS) it is often helpful to only display page content and not include header navigation and the sidebar.

To do this, add `onlydisplaypagecontent:true` to your page URLs. For example, to only display the content of the page at [demo.hibbittsdesign.org/grav-course-hub-bootstrap/home/week-03/](http://demo.hibbittsdesign.org/grav-course-hub-bootstrap/home/week-03/) you would use the revised URL of [demo.hibbittsdesign.org/grav-course-hub-bootstrap/home/week-03/onlydisplaypagecontent:true](http://demo.hibbittsdesign.org/grav-course-hub-bootstrap/home/week-03/onlydisplaypagecontent:true)

##### Customizing your theme

The Open Course Hub skeleton package comes with an [Inherited Theme](https://learn.getgrav.org/themes/customization#theme-inheritance) called 'mytheme' all ready for your further customization.

In addition, this theme is also automatically synced to the Git repository of your site. This means that you can invite other people, such as fellow educators or your students, to assist in the further customization of your site.
